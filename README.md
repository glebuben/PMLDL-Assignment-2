## Assignment description
This assignment is to create a recommender system of movies for users:
* Your system should suggest some movies to the user based on user's gemographic information(age, gender, occupation, zip code) and favorite movies (list of movie ids).
* Solve this task using a machine learning model. You may consider only one model: it will be enough.
* Create a benchmark that would evaluate the quality of recommendations of your model. Look for commonly used metrics to evaluate a recommender system and use at least one metric.
* Make a single report describing data exploration, solution implementation, training process, and evaluation on the benchmark.
* Explicitly state the benchmark scores of your systems.

## Repository structure

### [ðŸ“‚ data](./data)
* #### [ðŸ“‚ external](./data/external) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &ensp; # Data from third party sources
* #### [ðŸ“‚ interim](./data/interim) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; # Intermediate data that has been transformed.
* #### [ðŸ“‚ raw](./data/raw) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &nbsp; # The original, immutable data

### [ðŸ“‚ models](./models) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &ensp; # Trained and serialized models, final checkpoints

### [ðŸ“‚ notebooks](./notebooks) &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &nbsp;  # Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is a number (for ordering)
