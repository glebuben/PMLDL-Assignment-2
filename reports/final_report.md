# Introduction
Assignment task involves crafting a movie recommender system tailored to usersâ€™ preferences. The movie recommendation 
problem revolves around providing personalized suggestions to users by analyzing various facets of movies and users 
themselves. These systems not only enhance user experience by offering tailored suggestions but also assist platforms 
in increasing user engagement and retention. Techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, 
matrix factorization, and deep learning are commonly employed to generate accurate and relevant recommendations.

The fusion of LightGCN's graph-based collaborative filtering with feature-enhanced embeddings showcases a [promising
approach](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4257664) toward addressing the challenges inherent in 
movie recommendation systems. Hence, I endeavored to execute this strategy in practice.
